# User Behavior Analysis in Online Learning Platforms Using Graphs

**Analyze and Visualize User Behavior in Online Learning Platforms**  
Understand user interaction patterns and engagement in e-learning environments by utilizing graph-based techniques and machine learning.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project leverages graph theory and machine learning to analyze user behavior on online learning platforms. By examining how users interact with various learning resources, we can gain insights into engagement trends, completion rates, and areas for improvement. 

Key goals include:
- Detecting learning patterns and behaviors.
- Identifying factors influencing user engagement.
- Providing actionable insights for platform enhancement.

## 🎯 Objectives

- **Data Collection and Processing:** Collect, clean, and preprocess user activity data from online learning platforms.
- **Graph Construction:** Model user interactions as a graph, where nodes represent users and content, and edges indicate user interactions with content.
- **Behavioral Analysis:** Apply graph-based analysis to detect behavior patterns and engagement levels.
- **Machine Learning Integration:** Use machine learning techniques to classify users based on behavior patterns.
- **Visualization:** Visualize the graph and behavioral trends to provide a clear understanding of user activity.

## 📈 Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and transform raw data into a usable format.
2. **Graph Construction:** Represent users, content, and interactions as a graph.
3. **Graph Analysis:**
   - Use network metrics (e.g., degree centrality, clustering coefficients) to uncover insights.
   - Identify learning paths, common sequences, and potential bottlenecks.
4. **User Segmentation with Machine Learning:** Cluster users into categories based on their behavior.
5. **Visualization and Reporting:** Generate visualizations for insights and recommendations.
